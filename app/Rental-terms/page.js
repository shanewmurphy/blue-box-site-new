          indemnified by You if We take steps to enforce the Agreement
          (including the sale of Goods) due to Your failure to identify a
          payment. We will not accept that payment has been made until it has
          received cleared funds. Where You have more than one Unit/Agreement
          with Us, all will form one account with Us and We may choose to apply

          This Agreement does not confer on You any right to exclusive
          possession of the Unit and We reserve the right to relocate You to
          another Unit not smaller than the current Unit: (a) by giving 14 days’
          notice during which You can elect to terminate this Agreement under
          condition 12.1; or (b) on shorter notice if an incident occurs that
          requires the Unit or section where it is located to be closed or
          sealed off. In these circumstances, We will pay Your reasonable costs
          of removal if approved in writing by Us before removal. If You do not
          arrange removal by the date specified in Our notice, then You
          authorise Us and its agents to enter the Unit and move the Goods as
          Your agent on Your behalf and at Your risk (except for damage caused
          wilfully or negligently which is subject to the limitations in
          condition 9.2). Following removal this Agreement will be varied by
          substitution of the new Unit number but otherwise continues on the
          same terms at the storage rates in force for the original Unit at the
          time of the removal.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          You must ensure the Unit is suitable for the storage of the Goods
          intended to be stored in it and You are advised to inspect the Unit
          before storing Goods and periodically during the Storage Period. We
          make no warranty or representation that any unit is suitable for any
          particular goods and accept no liability in this regard. Unit sizes
          are approximate. If You have exact requirements, You must check with
          Us before signing this Agreement as, by signing, You agree to the
          actual size of the Unit and not any represented unit size.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          We may refuse storage of any Goods or require You to remove Goods if
          in Our opinion storage of such Goods creates a risk to the safety of
          any person or property.
